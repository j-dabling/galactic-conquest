# Galactic Conquest
An independent video game inspired by Star Wars Battlefront's (2005) Galactic Conquest mode.

## Requrements:
In it's current state, the game requires the Godot game-engine (godotengine.org) to run or edit files.
Open Godot, and import the project from the project.godot file inside of the repository.
